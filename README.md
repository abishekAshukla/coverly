Coverly is a web-based ecommerce platform that allows users to shop for their favorite mobile phone back covers for their smartphones. This project is built on Next.js, a React.js framework. It's my first Next.js based project, and I've learned both basics and some advanced concepts of Next.js while building it.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel

## Challenges

Building Coverly came with its own set of challenges. Here are some challenges I faced while working on this project:

1. **Payment Integration**: Integrating payment gateways can be challenging due to various security considerations, handling different payment methods, and ensuring a smooth checkout process.

2. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implementing user authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users can access certain parts of the application can be complex.

3. **Infinite Scrolling**: Implementing infinite scrolling requires careful management of data fetching and rendering to provide a seamless user experience.

4. **Pagination**: Designing a robust pagination system to efficiently handle large numbers of products or listings while maintaining performance can be tricky.

5. **Search Functionality with Token Cancellation**: Creating a search functionality with token cancellation for improved security and performance can be challenging to implement.

6. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Implementing static site generation for improved performance and SEO involves configuring Next.js correctly and handling dynamic content generation.

7. **Database Management (MongoDB)**: Designing the database schema, managing data relationships, and ensuring efficient queries can pose challenges, especially when working with NoSQL databases like MongoDB.

8. **Error Handling and Validation**: Implementing robust error handling and input validation to provide a reliable and secure user experience can be a significant challenge.
